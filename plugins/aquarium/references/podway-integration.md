# Podway Integration Contract

Read this reference whenever `task-handler`, `epic-handler`, `epic-validator`, `new-project`, `new-feature`, `refactor`, `war-room`, or `design-qa` uses its default Podway path. Each owning workflow reads [evidence-residency.md](evidence-residency.md) independently even when Podway is opted out or unavailable. Skip only this Podway reference when the current user explicitly opts the workflow out before its managed session starts or a higher-priority instruction prohibits Podway. A non-Git `new-project` also skips Podway completely. Podway records and guards procedure state; it does not run commands, validate the truth of evidence, mutate Git, or replace repository authority.

Reference `/skill:use-podway` when it is installed and valid, and follow it for current Procedure v2 command grammar, state loops, lifecycle, authoring, and recovery mechanics. This contract remains authoritative for Aquarium roadmap authority, default selection, opt-out, readiness, session ownership, approval boundaries, and evidence mapping.

If the optional skill is unavailable or invalid on the default path, report that once and use the bounded mechanics below. When repository guidance requires it, stop and route the exact gap to `/skill:dev-setup` instead of falling back.

## Select Per Workflow

Select Podway by default for every Git-backed invocation of `task-handler`, `epic-handler`, `epic-validator`, `new-project`, `new-feature`, `refactor`, `war-room`, and `design-qa`. Exclude it only when:

- the current user explicitly asks to omit Podway from this workflow before its managed session starts; or
- a higher-priority system or repository instruction prohibits Podway.

Treat an opt-out in the plan or execution-envelope approval as approval of the same disclosed envelope without its Podway operations; do not require another approval merely to remove them. Keep the opt-out local to the named workflow. Re-select Podway by default for every later workflow; never carry an opt-out forward implicitly.

For an opted-out workflow, do not load or reference `/skill:use-podway`, run a Podway command, inspect daemon, workspace, Procedure, or session state, or let any Podway condition affect the workflow. A healthy, degraded, mismatched, or unfinished Podway session is invisible to that workflow.

## Check Readiness on the Default Path

Unless the workflow is already opted out, verify that Podway is ready for Aquarium use before requesting plan or execution-envelope approval. Readiness requires the supported stable `v0.2.5` through `v0.2.x` CLI and matching daemon on native Apple Silicon macOS, reachable healthy workspace state, `.podway/config.yaml`, `.podway/.gitignore`, and all five tracked managed files byte-identical to the plugin sources and valid under `podway procedure check --warnings-as-errors`:

- `.podway/procedures/aquarium-task-v2.yaml`;
- `.podway/procedures/aquarium-goal-v2.yaml`;
- `.podway/procedures/aquarium-validation-v2.yaml`;
- `.podway/procedures/aquarium-design-v2.yaml`;
- `.podway/procedures/aquarium-war-room-v2.yaml`.

These components describe availability and readiness only; the owning Aquarium invocation selects Podway by default. When readiness is incomplete or degraded, stop and ask the user to choose between repair through `/skill:dev-setup` and an explicit opt-out for this workflow. Do not silently fall back or reinterpret the workflow as opted out.

`readiness_status=not_configured` means the five managed Procedures are absent. It is unrelated to `LEGACY_PROCEDURE_STATE_UNSUPPORTED`, which means Podway found Procedure v1 runtime state. On that error, stop, preserve the exact worktree and error code, let the user make any desired backup, and route a separately approved `podway reset --all` recovery to `/skill:dev-setup`; never convert, edit, or delete runtime state directly.

## Keep Authorities Separate

- The canonical roadmap owns requirements, task and epic identity, lifecycle vocabulary, and official completion state.
- Podway owns the active procedure snapshot, attempt and rework history, recorded evidence, goal revisions, criterion assessments, and procedural terminal outcome.
- The Kimi Code goal is a temporary projection of the currently actionable Aquarium work recorded inside the Podway session. It may be absent during an explicitly goal-free read-only audit and may narrow to one owned remediation group, but it must never contradict or override the roadmap, Podway goal revision, or current node.
- Git commits, upstream publication, provider publication, live rollout, and external validation remain separate evidence states.

Podway evidence is a caller-recorded claim. Verify tests, reviews, approvals, revisions, and artifacts against their native authorities before recording them or making a decision.

## Read and Mutate Safely

Use `podway observe --json --wait-for-idle`; never parse human output. Require successful runtime commands to use `podway.output/v3`, observations to identify `podway.observation-result/v2`, prepared-aware status to identify `podway.status-result/v3` or `podway.compact-status-result/v3`, prepared-aware job reads to identify `podway.job-result/v4` or `podway.job-lookup-result/v4`, and failures to use `podway.error/v1`. Treat the observation as one authoritative snapshot: read identity and queue state from `status`, current guidance and allowed actions from `guidance`, bounded item declarations from `active_items`, and fenced recipes from `mutation_templates`. Add required semantic values only after reading command help and verifying their native authority. `podway version --json` retains its compact result.

Require prepared start or replacement to return `podway.session-start-result/v3`, begin to return `podway.session-begin-result/v1`, terminal disposition to return `podway.terminal-disposition-result/v1`, and reset to return `podway.session-reset-result/v1`. A successful envelope with another result schema is not proof of the requested mutation; stop and reconcile rather than advancing.

A fresh `start` or approved replacement creates a prepared revision-0 session with no attempt, cursor, goal, or active items. Re-observe it, require prepared guidance and the current `session.begin` mutation template, then use fresh workspace, session, and revision fences plus a distinct idempotency key to create attempt 1 and the initial goal, criteria, and actor. Do not record evidence or issue any item, goal, cursor, decision, rework, completion, or cancellation mutation before `begin` succeeds. A matching prepared session is recoverable workflow state: resume with `begin` only when its Procedure, canonical identity, and recoverable approval all match.

Running guidance carries the ordinary workflow actions. Terminal observation has null guidance and no active items; an undisposed terminal revision offers only terminal disposition, while a disposed terminal revision offers eligible reset and replacement. Never infer terminal ownership from null guidance alone.

Before every mutation, re-observe and pass every applicable workspace, session, session-revision, attempt, goal-revision, and item-revision fence plus a deterministic operation-specific idempotency key. Select only commands present in the latest `mutation_templates`, fill semantic placeholders only from verified work, and use only IDs from machine fields such as `allowed_option_ids` and `allowed_manual_rework_targets`. Use `podway help <route>` rather than inventing flags.

After every successful mutation, re-observe rather than calculating revisions locally. On a precondition failure, re-observe and derive the next action again. On `MUTATION_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, use `podway --json job lookup --idempotency-key <key>`, require `podway.job-lookup-result/v4`, and reconcile the durable result before considering resubmission with the same canonical request and key.

Record bounded summaries and references, not source contents, credentials, raw provider payloads, or full logs. For checks record the exact command, actor provenance, exit status, current source revision or dirty-tree identity, and a digest or stable evidence reference. For review record the ordinal and mode, exact target and run identity, coverage and publication status, findings-query status, unresolved valid findings, and any deferred run and finding identities.

These records are local runtime and orchestration evidence. Never copy them, their `.podway/runtime/**` location, or their Mulgae or Gaori runtime references into tracked documentation as a validation or remediation log. When a later repository consumer requires durable evidence, verify and promote the native evidence through the shared residency contract; Podway's recorded claim is not a promotion source.

## Own Sessions Conservatively

Only `task-handler`, `epic-handler`, `epic-validator`, `new-project`, `new-feature`, `refactor`, `war-room`, and `design-qa` may own or advance an Aquarium Podway workflow session, and only on the default Podway path for that exact workflow. A standalone user request that explicitly invokes `/skill:use-podway` may inspect, cancel, or discard the exact current session without adopting roadmap or workflow ownership. `/skill:dev-setup` may inspect only the bounded session facts needed for readiness diagnosis. `/skill:task-commit` may inspect only bounded read-only current-session facts needed to identify the owning workflow and must never advance or mutate Podway. Leaf and other utility skills, including upstream Ouroboros skills, stay Podway-blind and return native evidence to their caller.

Before delegating work, the owner re-observes and verifies the expected immutable Procedure ID, canonical workflow identity, session, lifecycle, and revision; a running session must also match its attempt, goal revision, and current graph node. After delegation, the owner independently verifies the leaf postcondition, records only the supported bounded evidence with fresh fences, and selects only a transition allowed by the observation guidance and represented by a current mutation template. The leaf never inspects or records Podway state.

A session is owned by the current Aquarium workflow only when its immutable Procedure ID and task title or canonical identity match. For any nonmatching session, report its session ID, Procedure ID, lifecycle, revision, current node and attempt when present, disposition, and available canonical identity, then classify it by lifecycle rather than treating every nonmatch as a reset prerequisite:

- A prepared, running, incomplete, or undisposed terminal session is a blocking lifecycle conflict, not degraded readiness. Resume unfinished work through its matching owner, leave it untouched through an explicit opt-out for the new workflow, or manage cancellation or deletion through a standalone explicit `/skill:use-podway` request. Never route it to `/skill:dev-setup` repair.
- A disposed terminal session is an eligible successor candidate only when its authoritative artifacts and stable handoff reference still verify and the current observation exposes `session.start_replace`. Include replacement of that exact revision in the successor's execution envelope; after approval, atomically use `start --replace-eligible`, re-observe, and `begin` without a separate reset.
- If terminal disposition, handoff evidence, or the replacement template is missing or stale, keep the session in the blocking lifecycle-conflict path. Never invent `handed_off` or `not_required` merely to free the slot.

Never cancel, reset, force-replace, reopen, or reinterpret a blocking lifecycle conflict automatically. When deletion itself is the user's intent and no approved successor will replace the session, provide an exact `/skill:use-podway` current-session discard handoff naming the repository and observed session ID; that handoff grants no cleanup authority by itself. Reset is deletion, not preparation for a successor workflow.

Do not mutate Podway before the workflow's existing plan or execution-envelope approval. On the default path, disclose prepared session start or resume, the separate fenced `begin`, all bounded workflow mutations, any terminal disposition, and any eligible replacement or reset in that plan or envelope; approval covers only those disclosed operations. Accept an explicit opt-out until the first managed-session mutation.

After the session starts, do not abandon it and continue without Podway. Classify a later stop or opt-out request through the flow below. A changed desired outcome requires `podway --json goal revise` with a declared rework target; it must not be disguised as another item update.

## Record Terminal Ownership Conservatively

Treat terminal disposition as a caller assertion about ownership outside the session, not as workflow success, evidence publication, or a durable Aquarium record. It does not create a roadmap edit, commit, push, or agent handoff. Record one only after re-observing the exact completed or cancelled revision and verifying the asserted semantics against native authority.

- Use `handed_off` only when an exact authoritative external result already exists. For a roadmap task, re-read its successful lifecycle, required evidence, clean task-owned residue, and actual commit, then use a bounded summary plus a stable reference containing the exact commit SHA. The presence of a roadmap entry without that completed external result is insufficient.
- Use `not_required` only when no final external handoff or repository result is required and current roadmap, Git, review, and worktree evidence has been re-read. This covers a disclosed internal boundary retained by the same approved `epic-handler`, an epic-handler closeout with no final repository diff, and an achieved `epic-validator` run whose lifecycle, current requirements, accepted risks, and actionable handoffs require no final repository result. Earlier task or remediation commits do not prevent this disposition; record them as verified predecessors and record the concrete no-final-result reason. Never use `not_required` merely because no handoff reference is available.
- Otherwise leave the terminal revision undisposed. Do not invent a reference or reason, and never choose force reset or force replacement automatically. A final session may remain terminal after `handed_off` or remain undisposed when no disposition is supported.

After a fresh supported disposition, re-observe and use only the eligible reset or `session.start_replace` template exposed for that exact revision. When an approved successor workflow needs the worktree slot, prefer atomic `start --replace-eligible` so deletion and creation of its prepared session share one fenced mutation; then re-observe and `begin` it. A standalone task, validation, design, war-room, or final epic session is not reset merely because it is terminal.

## Hand Off Across Workflow Owners

An owner-prefixed session identity prevents one workflow owner from resuming another owner's session. Cross-owner continuation is therefore replace-after-disposition, never automatic resume:

1. The predecessor re-observes its exact terminal revision and verifies the approved artifacts, their current digests, effective Design Gate state, repository status, and any commit required by repository authority. It records `handed_off` only with a bounded summary, stable non-runtime artifact reference, exact session ID and revision, and the named successor skill. A required commit uses its exact SHA; an approved document that does not require a commit uses canonical paths and content digests from the unchanged target snapshot; durable evidence uses only a tracked promoted manifest and digest.
2. The successor includes replacement of that exact disposed terminal revision in its own execution envelope. Approval of the predecessor workflow alone does not authorize the replacement or successor work.
3. After successor approval, re-observe and require that the same terminal revision is disposed, its artifact reference still verifies, and a current eligible `session.start_replace` template exists. Use only that template with fresh fences to create the successor's owner-prefixed prepared session, then re-observe and `begin` it.
4. If the predecessor is running, prepared, undisposed, incomplete, cancelled without a valid disposition, changed after handoff, or lacks a current replacement template, stop. Return the exact matching-owner continuation, explicit `/skill:use-podway` lifecycle handoff, or workflow opt-out allowed by current state; never force replacement.

## Handle In-Progress Stop Requests

When the user asks to stop after the first managed-session mutation, stop Aquarium work and clarify the intended disposition from the choices below. Do not interpret an unqualified stop request as permission to cancel or reset, and do not use `podway block` for an ordinary pause.

- **Resume later:** Leave the session active without a Podway mutation. Report its identity, lifecycle and revision, current node and attempt when present, recorded progress, queue state, and the exact continuation request. A later matching workflow may resume it; another default Podway workflow remains blocked by the active session.
- **Abandon and preserve history:** Explain that `cancel` ends the task rather than pausing it and that a cancelled session never reactivates. Reference `/skill:use-podway`, observe and summarize the exact current session, obtain explicit authorization to cancel that session, use only the fresh supported mutation template, then re-observe and report the terminal state.
- **Delete the session:** Explain that `reset` irreversibly deletes session-scoped history while preserving workspace initialization. Follow `/skill:use-podway`'s current-session discard flow: observe and summarize the exact session, preview the fenced reset with `--dry-run`, show its `none`, `record_disposition`, or `force` requirement and the history loss, obtain every required semantic value, then obtain separate explicit authorization, re-observe, execute the fresh fenced eligible or explicitly confirmed force reset, and verify `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`. Do not cancel first when deletion or freeing the session slot is the goal.

Keep Podway lifecycle, the roadmap, Git, and the Kimi Code goal separate. None of these dispositions commits work, changes roadmap state, or proves the goal achieved. If the user wants remaining Aquarium work to continue without Podway, finish the selected disposition and start a new explicitly opted-out workflow; never switch the current workflow in place.

For sequential epic delivery, use one `aquarium-goal-v2` session per member task, pre-validation remediation, or closeout goal. Once `aquarium-validation-v2` starts, record its audit-owned remediation and re-audit inside that session because a worktree cannot host a nested goal session.

Replace any Aquarium session only after it is successfully terminal, its authoritative artifacts, Design Gate or roadmap state, evidence, required commit, and worktree have been re-read, and the exact terminal revision has a supported disposition. The approved successor envelope may authorize that exact eligible replacement. A Procedure update never migrates an active snapshot and applies only to a later session.

## Map the Managed Procedures

- `aquarium-task-v2` is owned by `task-handler`; its nodes correspond to the approved plan, implementation, verification record and decision, refinement, documentation, Mulgae review record and decision, goal assessment, the assessed outcome with its follow-up commitments, final user approval, and closeout. Its plan record has an optional `plan-handoff-artifact` item that only an explicit `task-handler` plan handoff fills.
- `aquarium-goal-v2` is owned by `epic-handler` for one member-task, pre-validation remediation, or closeout goal outside an active validation session. Its work record has an optional `plan-handoff-artifact` item that the owning handler propagates only for an explicit epic plan handoff. The epic closeout goal therefore starts only after the validation session is successfully terminal, has a supported disposition, and is atomically replaced with the prepared closeout session.
- `aquarium-validation-v2` is owned by `epic-handler` for its final epic audit and by `epic-validator` for cold validation and convergence. Its baseline record has an optional `plan-handoff-artifact` item for continuity from `epic-handler`; `epic-validator` leaves it absent and exposes no plan-handoff mode. Each remediate record covers whatever remediation its owner completes before the next audit: one goal for `epic-handler`, the full confirmed-gap group set for `epic-validator`.
- `aquarium-design-v2` is owned by `new-project`, `new-feature`, `refactor`, or `design-qa` for one Git-backed design-document lifecycle. Ouroboros discovery and QA are leaf evidence; the owner retains Podway and repository authority.
- `aquarium-war-room-v2` is owned only by `war-room`; it ends with an approved task, epic, or incomplete-investigation document and never records a fix implementation.

The owner records a leaf report only after independently checking the leaf postcondition. A failed check or valid unresolved review finding must select the failure route and create fresh rework evidence while an authorized remediation budget remains. The only exceptions are epic-handler's explicit second-review member-task deferral and a confirmation-only review hold awaiting user direction; neither exception may be reinterpreted as clean review evidence. A final Podway `achieved` outcome cannot make a non-successful roadmap task successful, replace required approval, create a commit, or establish publication.
