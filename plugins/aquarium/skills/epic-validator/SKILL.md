# Epic Validator

Validate a completed epic independently of how it was delivered. Audit first, remediate the first confirmed findings once, run one confirmation review, and require user direction before any further correction or review. Read [release-notes.md](../../references/release-notes.md). Do not invoke `/skill:task-handler`, `/skill:epic-handler`, their phase skills, or `/skill:independent-review`.

Always read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md) and [documentation-governance.md](../../references/documentation-governance.md). Use Podway by default. Exclude it only when the current user explicitly opts this validation out before its managed session starts or a higher-priority instruction prohibits it. For an opted-out validation, do not inspect Podway, load `/skill:use-podway`, or read [podway-integration.md](../../references/podway-integration.md), and do not carry the opt-out into a later workflow.

Otherwise read the Podway contract and use one `aquarium-validation-v2` session for this exact cold-validation lifecycle. Podway records each bounded pass and user disposition; the roadmap and current implementation remain the semantic authority.

## Establish the Validation Contract

Require one mutable Git repository, one canonical roadmap path inside it, and exactly one epic ID present in that roadmap. Reject task-only requests, multiple epics, and requests without one canonical roadmap epic identity.

Before requesting approval:

1. Read instructions, the epic, member tasks, `docs/README.md`, the active dossier when the epic is not yet completed, linked canonical outcomes, decisions, contracts, operations runbooks, tests, documentation, and required or generated artifacts. For a completed epic with dossier-contract evidence, treat any remaining adopted dossier or `Detailed SOT` reference, any missing `Canonical Outcomes`, or a broken outcome link as a documentation contract gap. Leave historical completed epics without lifecycle fields or declarations grandfathered and unchanged.
2. Confirm every member task is in a roadmap-defined successful state and its implementation has a committed evidence-backed baseline. The epic itself may be in review or a successful state. When a member task is incomplete, stop and report which handler the user should run; never invoke it here.
3. Inspect branch, upstream, HEAD, staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted state. Record the validation baseline and separate epic-owned residue from unrelated work. Stop when the epic baseline is uncommitted or cannot be isolated safely.
4. Discover repository-native verification, Gaori, `/skill:use-gaori`, documentation synchronization, Mulgae, `/skill:use-mulgae`, Sanho, `/skill:use-sanho`, lifecycle, and commit guidance. Treat each CLI, repository configuration, project MCP, and agent skill as independent state. Inspect explicit external dependencies read-only and record repository, canonical identity, exact revision, lifecycle, dirty state, evidence, and owner.
5. Inspect the current goal and stop rather than replace a different unfinished goal.
6. Honor an explicit pre-session opt-out without Podway discovery and ignore every Podway readiness or session state. Otherwise apply the shared contract's readiness and session checks. On degraded readiness, stop and ask the user to choose `/skill:dev-setup` repair or an explicit opt-out for this validation.
   - Resume a managed validation session matching this epic and baseline. Only when starting a different session, present the existing session and obtain the shared contract's explicit preserve, lifecycle, delete, or eligible-replace choice. Never route by skill owner or describe the choice as setup repair.
   - A disposed terminal session with verified handoff evidence and a current `session.start_replace` template becomes an exact successor candidate. Include its automatic archival in the validation envelope and, after approval, execute the template's current plain `start` argv without a separate reset before re-observing and beginning the prepared validation session.

Present one bounded validation envelope covering direct audit, authorized checks, disclosed Mulgae source transmission, remediation of confirmed gaps required by existing epic authority, canonical documentation only when current semantics change, conditionally required evidence promotion, isolated staging, and one commit per actual remediation or lifecycle diff. Ask once for explicit approval. A clean validation with no canonical change creates no repository diff or validation-record commit.

Approval does not cover new product requirements, another repository, amend, push, PR or release changes, live rollout, destructive actions, installation, or unrelated staging.

By default the envelope must cover creating or resuming the prepared validation session, the separate fenced `begin`, bounded evidence recording, decisions, rework, goal assessment, terminal completion, and any supported terminal disposition. Treat approval that explicitly omits Podway as approval of the same envelope without those operations.

Accept that opt-out only before the first managed-session mutation. Afterward classify every stop or opt-out request through the shared `Handle In-Progress Stop Requests` flow; never assume pause, cancel, reset, or an in-place switch to non-Podway execution. Never reset or replace another session automatically.

Do not create a goal, edit files, invoke providers, stage, commit, or alter external state before approval.

When a selected long or noisy check is routed through Gaori, reference `/skill:use-gaori` and follow it when available. If it is missing and repository policy requires it, stop and route to `/skill:dev-setup`; otherwise run the repository's original documented command directly and report that evidence compression was unavailable. Never infer an unknown original command, and keep command result, extraction quality, and acceptance authority separate throughout audits and remediation.

Before each authorized Mulgae review, reference `/skill:use-mulgae` and follow it when available, preferring its attached MCP workflow. If the skill or project MCP is unavailable and repository policy requires it, stop and route that exact gap to `/skill:dev-setup`; otherwise use the supported configured CLI fallback, report the unavailable integration once, and preserve exact preflight, run, publication, and findings evidence. Never start a second MCP server or blindly retry an uncertain review mutation.

For each operationally complete whole-epic root review, record the next positive ordinal for the current validation goal revision, the exact committed run ID, and valid Critical, High, Medium, and Low counts plus finding IDs. Round one is `remediation-eligible`; round two and every user-authorized later review are `confirmation-only`. On resumption, reconstruct the ordinal from verbose validation Procedure history and exact run IDs; an unprovable ordinal stops before review. Cold validation never selects `hardening-deferral-eligible` mode.

## Audit the Epic Directly

Run the audit without an active goal and without source mutation:

1. Build a requirement-to-owner-to-production-to-test-to-document matrix across every member task. Trace runtime wiring, consumers, persistence, concurrency, migrations, generated artifacts, failure and recovery behavior, operational guidance, external dependencies, roadmap consistency, absence of the completed epic's dossier, and coverage by its canonical outcome links.
2. Inspect current code and evidence directly. Run only repository-authorized checks needed for the epic claim. Keep current agent-run, explicit user-run, unavailable, forbidden, stale, external, live, commit, and upstream publication evidence distinct; narrow green checks do not prove uncovered requirements.
3. Run Mulgae on one exact latest epic target that excludes unrelated work and includes every epic-owned staged, unstaged, untracked, generated, and derived file.
4. Treat a Mulgae review as operationally complete only when `coverage_status=complete`, `ci_decision=pass`, `publication_status=committed`, and the findings query succeeds. Classify that complete review as clean only when zero unresolved valid findings remain; otherwise apply the bounded remediation or explicit disposition rules below. Provider success or exit status alone is insufficient.
   Record `structured_extraction_status` independently as `structured`, `mixed`, or `reports_only`. `reports_only` is not itself a failure and does not replace or relax any completion condition above; the accepted reports remain authoritative, and every extracted finding remains an advisory hypothesis that requires local verification.
5. Verify every candidate finding against current authority and implementation. Record only confirmed gaps; do not turn review hypotheses into work automatically.

With Podway active, create or resume the matching prepared validation session only after approval, re-observe and `begin` it, then run `podway observe --json --wait-for-idle` before each bounded audit or remediation delegation and verify the expected Procedure ID, epic and baseline identity, session, lifecycle, revision, attempt, goal revision, and current node. Independently verify returned native evidence before recording the baseline and fresh audit or deciding whether gaps exist.

Select only actions allowed by `guidance.allowed_actions` and represented by current `mutation_templates` entries. A clean decision advances to final review; confirmed gaps advance to remediation. Do not record candidate findings as confirmed Podway gaps before adjudication.

## Group and Complete Remediation Goals

Group confirmed gaps by canonical requirement owner and coherent implementation boundary. Do not add new roadmap tasks or invent task IDs.

- For a gap owned by one existing task, create or resume one remediation goal containing that task ID and hand the isolated correction to `/skill:task-commit` under that task ID. If the roadmap defines a reopen state, transition through it and return to success; otherwise preserve the successful state without adding remediation history to the roadmap.
- For a cross-task seam or omitted epic-level design requirement owned by no existing task, create one epic remediation goal and hand the isolated correction to `/skill:task-commit` under the epic ID.
- For work owned by another repository, stop with its owner, exact revision, and missing evidence. Never mutate that repository.

If ownership is ambiguous, stop before goal creation and report the missing authority. Order task-owned groups by dependencies and roadmap order, then epic-owned groups. Never run two remediation goals concurrently.

For each goal:

1. Implement the smallest complete correction, add or update regression coverage and any durable specification required by changed current behavior, and run affected authorized checks. In an enrolled repository, include one concise release-note `entry` for a changed shipped outcome or record `intentional no-note`; otherwise record `not-enrolled`.
2. Fix every valid in-scope finding from the initial audit and root review, then repeat affected checks without starting a per-goal or follow-up review.
3. Update the roadmap only for an actual lifecycle change, current accepted risk, or actionable downstream handoff. Never add a routine `Validation remediation`, `Validation record`, command log, tested snapshot, runtime path, run ID, or commit list.
4. Record resulting remediation commit IDs in Podway and the orchestration report, not in canonical documentation.

Confirm the goal-owned diff, including any necessary lifecycle or current-semantics documentation, equals the verified correction for the recorded source findings. Hand that exact scope, its evidence, owning task or epic ID, release-note target and decision, zero or more approved promoted manifest path and digest pairs or their explicit absence, and approved one-commit authority to `/skill:task-commit`.

Verify the returned commit snapshot, residue, and hook evidence before completing the goal. The later whole-epic confirmation review, not the source review, owns coverage of those committed bytes.

## Confirm Once and Stop on New Findings

After all initial remediation goals complete, discard the prior matrix, findings, checks, and review result. With no active goal, repeat the direct audit and run exactly one round-two whole-epic Mulgae confirmation review from the latest committed snapshot. Do not start a third review automatically.

If round two is operationally incomplete, stop without retry. If it has no valid finding, continue normal closeout. Critical or High findings block validation and require user direction. One or more Medium findings stop with a recommendation to authorize exactly one correction-and-review budget, explicitly accept the named risk, or stop. When only Low findings remain, recommend either accepting their exact IDs or applying an eligible micro correction, then wait for the user's choice.

A micro correction is eligible only when it needs no product or authority choice, has no security, privacy, public API, schema, migration, persistence, lifecycle, or cross-repository impact, is safely isolated, and has a focused deterministic check. After the user selects the exact correction, implement it once, run affected checks, commit through `/skill:task-commit`, and proceed without another Mulgae review. Record `user-authorized-micro-fix` and state that the last root review predates the correction; never describe it as review-covered.

Record ignored Low findings as `accepted-low` with exact IDs and rationale. Record a user-accepted Medium as `accepted-medium-risk`; neither is a clean review, and Critical or High findings cannot use risk acceptance. For a named consumer that requires durable accepted-risk evidence, create the approved package only after review and disposition. Before handoff, this owning workflow verifies live native evidence, target digest, and copied projection, then passes that result and package through the shared commit boundary without roadmap execution history.

Each user-authorized correction grants one remediation and one next-ordinal confirmation review only. Apply this same severity decision again after that review and ask again rather than restoring an automatic loop.

With Podway active, record each remediation group, fresh audit, severity count, finding ID, and exact user disposition. Leave the decision unset while user direction is required. Assess criteria and complete the session only from the latest evidence plus any explicit accepted-risk or micro-fix record.

When an external blocker is resolved, revalidate its exact committed revision and evidence before restarting the audit. Any code, test, durable documentation, generated product artifact, or derived product artifact change after verification or final review makes affected evidence stale; the exact planned lifecycle or accepted-risk-only roadmap change and an approved post-review promoted-evidence projection are the sole exceptions. The projection remains outside the review target and receives independent commit-boundary validation.

Declare completion only when every required check has current passing evidence, whole-epic Mulgae evidence is operationally complete, every member task and the epic have roadmap-defined successful states, no epic-owned residue remains, and one of these closeout conditions holds:

- The fresh from-scratch audit and latest review are clean.
- Every remaining Medium and Low finding has an explicit `accepted-medium-risk` or `accepted-low` disposition, with no Critical or High finding.
- Every selected Low-only micro correction has current focused evidence and a `user-authorized-micro-fix` record that identifies the preceding review as predating the correction.

An incomplete review or `stop` disposition never supports completion. Store the final audited snapshot, commands, runtime paths, run identities, and detailed evidence only in Podway, native runtime, and the orchestration report. Commit an isolated epic-ID diff through `/skill:task-commit` only when lifecycle, a current accepted risk, or an actionable handoff changed; otherwise complete with an explicit no-change result and never create a validation record or empty commit.

With Podway active, complete the validation session only after any required canonical commit and clean residue are verified. Record `handed_off` with the exact final validation-owned repository result when one is required. When no final repository result is required, record `not_required` with the verified reason even if earlier task or remediation commits exist. Leave the final terminal session intact and never invent a reference or choose force cleanup.

## Hand Off Commits and Report Safely

Every actual remediation, lifecycle, accepted-risk, or actionable-handoff commit goes through `/skill:task-commit`. Include repository, roadmap, task or epic ID, lifecycle and record decisions, release-note decision, isolated scope, verification and Mulgae evidence, zero or more promoted manifest path and digest pairs or their explicit absence, and one-commit authority.

That skill owns staging, Lore and Sanho commit-boundary checks, the direct commit, hook reconciliation, and byte-for-byte snapshot verification. Never commit independently.

Use `/skill:use-sanho` directly only for separately authorized synchronization outside the commit boundary. Commit is not upstream publication. Do not push, amend, open or modify a PR, release, or claim live validation without separate authority and evidence. Request renewed approval when remediation would add a new requirement, cross repository scope, cause destructive impact, or exceed a safely isolatable existing epic requirement.

Do not create or read `.aquarium` or other shadow state. Resume from roadmap, Git history and worktree, current goal, recoverable approval, repository evidence, and Mulgae records. At each stop report baseline, audit status, remediation groups and owners, current goal, commits, checks, Mulgae capture and findings status, canonical changes or explicit no-change state, worktree boundaries, publication state, and exact next safe action.
