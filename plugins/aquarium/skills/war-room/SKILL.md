# War Room

Diagnose one difficult bug and stop at an evidence-backed work-unit proposal. Do not implement a fix, mutate production or shared services, stage, commit, publish, or edit the Design Gate registry.

Read [ouroboros-integration.md](../../references/ouroboros-integration.md) and [design-gates.md](../../references/design-gates.md), then use the default `aquarium-war-room-v2` Podway path. Keep repository sources read-only. Reproduce only in isolated fixtures or an already authorized safe environment, preserve commands and observations, distinguish symptoms from causes, and test competing hypotheses.

After the approved envelope, use installed upstream `/skill:interview` and `/skill:qa` as needed to challenge the investigation. Classify the result as exactly one of: a bounded task, a multi-work-unit epic, or investigation incomplete. Include scope, evidence, root cause or remaining hypotheses, acceptance evidence, dependencies, risks, and an explicit `Design Gate impact` on every resulting implementation task, propagating the epic decision when an epic is produced. Any gate candidate remains `Pending` for `/skill:design-qa`.

Run a final quality pass, record its adjudicated result at `quality`, and require `decide-quality` to pass with zero unresolved locally valid findings before showing the exact proposed roadmap or investigation-note diff. Apply it only after explicit approval and snapshot recheck.

Route every quality-driven evidence, classification, or draft revision back to `investigate`. For user-requested wording-only changes after a quality-passed draft is already on the valid trace, use only that draft's current allowed manual-rework target before recording an approval decision so the flow returns through `quality` and a fresh quality decision. If the user instead records `changes-requested`, preserve the unapplied proposal at `record-rejection` and close the session without document mutation.

End with the classification, evidence paths, applied documents, unresolved gaps, and the explicit next workflow. Never continue into the fix.
