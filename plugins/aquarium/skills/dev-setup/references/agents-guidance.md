# Reference-Based AGENTS.md Guidance

Use this reference only after the user approves preparation of an AGENTS.md proposal.

## Minimal reference section

Adapt names only when the installed skill namespace differs:

```markdown
## Development skill references

- Use `/skill:task-handler` for one named roadmap task.
- Use `/skill:epic-handler` to implement one roadmap epic as sequential task goals.
- Use `/skill:epic-validator` to cold-validate and remediate one completed roadmap epic.
- Use `/skill:new-project`, `/skill:new-feature`, or `/skill:refactor` for an explicitly requested Ouroboros-assisted project or epic design workflow.
- Use `/skill:war-room` to diagnose one difficult bug and stop at a task, epic, or incomplete-investigation proposal.
- Use `/skill:design-qa` to create, change, reactivate, or retire local Design Gates.
- Use `/skill:dev-setup` to diagnose or configure development tooling.
- Use `/skill:use-sanho` at an authorized commit or push boundary in a Sanho-managed repository, or for an explicitly requested Sanho operation.
- Use `/skill:use-mulgae` for an authorized Mulgae review, run inspection, finding follow-up, configuration diagnosis, cleanup plan, or recovery.
- Use `/skill:use-gaori` when a selected long or noisy check is routed through Gaori or existing Gaori evidence must be inspected.
- Let `/skill:task-handler`, `/skill:epic-handler`, `/skill:epic-validator`, `/skill:new-project`, `/skill:new-feature`, `/skill:refactor`, `/skill:war-room`, and `/skill:design-qa` use Podway by default for Git-backed workflows unless the current user opts out before the first managed-session mutation; Aquarium workflow skills retain their stricter roadmap, ownership, and approval rules.
- Use `/skill:use-podway` directly for an explicitly requested Procedure v2 session operation, authoring, lifecycle, diagnosis, recovery, cancellation, or current-session discard flow. Keep each owner opt-out local to its current workflow.
- Use `/skill:lore-commits` for non-trivial commit messages and `/skill:lore-query` to inspect recorded decision context.
- Use the separately installed upstream `/skill:deslop` skill for task-owned cleanup when an Aquarium workflow requests it.
- Repository-specific rules below override defaults from the referenced skills.

### Repository overrides

<only rules that actually differ from the referenced skills>
```

Omit a reference to a skill that is not selected or installed. In particular, omit `/skill:use-sanho`, `/skill:use-mulgae`, `/skill:use-gaori`, or `/skill:use-podway` when only the corresponding CLI is installed, and omit `/skill:deslop` when the upstream skill is unavailable. Omit the override heading when there are no overrides.

Repository guidance may require stricter Podway approval or prohibit it. The handlers' default selection never overrides that guidance, and repository availability alone does not start or authorize a Podway session.

## Classify existing guidance

Move or retain as an override only information that materially differs from the referenced skills, including:

- authoritative roadmap paths, lifecycle states, and task-ID normalization;
- exact test commands, permission limits, and Gaori command IDs, version pins, or repository-specific MCP requirements;
- Sanho documentation ownership, selected `sanho check` policies, project identity, conflict policy, or repository-specific exceptions;
- Mulgae role sets, provider routing, target selection, timeouts, artist inputs, or stricter authorization;
- Podway readiness, procedure overrides, lifecycle ownership, version constraints, or stricter session-reset policy;
- commit subject prefixes and task-ID formats that override Lore's generic summary line;
- project-specific sensitive paths, generated sources, fallback behavior, and unavailable gates.

Replace duplicated common workflow, generic Sanho commit/push safety prose, generic Mulgae target, MCP/CLI, status, finding, cancellation, cleanup, and recovery prose, generic Gaori execution, artifact-inspection, cancellation, cleanup, and recovery prose, generic Podway Procedure v2 operation, authoring, lifecycle, and recovery prose, Lore trailer vocabulary, and generic command examples with references. Preserve stricter Aquarium session ownership and approval rules. Preserve ambiguous text and call it out in the proposal rather than guessing that it is duplicate.

When a repository says Mulgae requires an explicit request, clarify whether explicit `/skill:task-handler` invocation is the authorized task-scoped request; do not silently weaken the repository rule.

## Produce and apply the proposal

1. Record the exact target path and current file bytes or object hash.
2. Show a complete diff that labels retained overrides through their final placement.
3. Explain any ambiguous text left unchanged.
4. Request a second ask/answer decision for that exact diff.
5. Re-read the target before writing. Any change invalidates approval.
6. Apply only the displayed patch and show the resulting diff.

Do not insert generated markers around unrelated content, rewrite the entire file for formatting, or modify nested AGENTS.md or other agent instruction files by default.
