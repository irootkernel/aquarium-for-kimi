# New Project

Create a PRD and initial roadmap for one new project. Do not implement code, initialize Git, stage, commit, or publish.

Always read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md), then read [ouroboros-integration.md](../../references/ouroboros-integration.md) and [documentation-governance.md](../../references/documentation-governance.md). For a Git-backed project, use the default `aquarium-design-v2` Podway path. For a non-Git project, skip Podway completely without skipping the evidence-residency contract.

Establish the project identity, users, problem, outcomes, exclusions, constraints, risks, dependencies, delivery slices, acceptance evidence, and implementation ownership. Use installed upstream `/skill:interview` and `/skill:pm` only after the approved execution envelope.

Select `single-scope` when one implementation owner has one roadmap. Select `multi-scope` when independently delivered surfaces need separate roadmaps; ask only when ownership remains ambiguous. Produce a user-facing root README, maintainer-facing `docs/README.md`, a PRD, one initial roadmap per delivery scope, every role index including operations, and one scope-local `TODO-*.md` dossier for each initial epic with tasks, recorded in that scope's adopted TODO index.

The PRD owns product intent; each dossier owns temporary implementation scope and acceptance until closeout. Use the shared default `EPIC-NNN` and per-roadmap `TASK-NNN` contract. Do not add a repository-local Aquarium state file or documentation validator.

Include an initial testing-foundation work unit that establishes `aquarium-test-contract/v1` through a later explicit `/skill:test-setup` invocation; a new project is not eligible for a legacy waiver.

Run upstream `/skill:qa` on the draft, adjudicate every issue, then present the exact paths and complete proposed diff. Apply documents only after explicit approval and snapshot recheck. Report resulting paths, validation, unresolved decisions, and the exact next explicit skill; do not begin delivery.
