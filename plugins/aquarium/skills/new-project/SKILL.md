# New Project

Create a PRD and initial roadmap for one new project. Do not implement code, initialize Git, create Design Gates, stage, commit, or publish.

Always read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md), then read [ouroboros-integration.md](../../references/ouroboros-integration.md), [design-gates.md](../../references/design-gates.md), and [documentation-governance.md](../../references/documentation-governance.md). For a Git-backed project, use the default `aquarium-design-v2` Podway path. For a non-Git project, skip Podway completely without skipping the evidence-residency contract.

Establish the project identity, users, problem, outcomes, exclusions, constraints, risks, dependencies, delivery slices, acceptance evidence, and implementation ownership. Use installed upstream `/skill:interview` and `/skill:pm` only after the approved execution envelope.

Select `single-scope` when one implementation owner has one roadmap. Select `multi-scope` when independently delivered surfaces need separate roadmaps; ask the user only when ownership remains ambiguous after discovery. Produce a PRD and one initial roadmap per delivery scope together with `docs/README.md` and every required role index, using the shared default `EPIC-NNN` and per-roadmap `TASK-NNN` identity contract. Do not add a repository-local Aquarium state file or documentation validator.

Include an initial testing-foundation work unit that establishes `aquarium-test-contract/v1` through a later explicit `/skill:test-setup` invocation; a new project is not eligible for a legacy waiver.

Put an explicit `Design Gate impact` of `Not required` or `Pending` on every implementation task, propagating the containing epic decision when applicable; gate creation requires a later explicit `/skill:design-qa` invocation.

Run upstream `/skill:qa` on the draft, adjudicate every issue, then present the exact paths and complete proposed diff. Apply documents only after explicit approval and snapshot recheck. Report resulting paths, validation, gate impact, unresolved decisions, and the exact next explicit skill; do not begin delivery.
