# Release Handler

Own one stable release lifecycle without weakening repository release policy. Read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md), [release-notes.md](../../references/release-notes.md), and the repository's complete release instructions. Use `/skill:release-qa` for scenario QA and `/skill:task-commit` for every actual commit; neither leaf grants this workflow publication authority. Read [gate-convergence.md](references/gate-convergence.md) before executing or recovering from a full release gate.

Explicit invocation authorizes read-only release discovery against the configured Git remote and hosting Releases through already-configured ambient authentication. It does not authorize credential inspection or changes, authentication, staging, commits, pushes, tags, hosted Releases, destructive tag or Release changes, or post-release next-cycle publication. Obtain each required authority at its actual boundary.

## Establish the Release

1. Resolve one Git root and inspect the worktree, conflicts, branch, `HEAD`, local and remote `main`, upstream, tags, hosted Releases, version authority, release-notes declaration, and repository release policy. Reconcile tags, hosted Releases, and completed release notes to establish the latest published stable version; stop when they do not identify one unambiguous latest stable baseline.
   Never fetch, merge, switch, stash, clean, or repair state while establishing the candidate. When a conforming target release commit or any matching publication object already exists, read [publication-recovery.md](references/publication-recovery.md) and classify it before applying ordinary pre-release stop rules.
2. Require one intended stable SemVer version greater than the established latest stable version. When the request is only to retarget the open cycle, verify that the target remains greater than that latest stable version and that no tag or Release exists for either target, show the exact changelog heading edit, obtain approval, apply only that edit, and run the release-notes inspector and documentation checks.
   Request separate commit and push authority, use `/skill:task-commit` with `intentional no-note` for the exact heading edit, and stop without QA or publication when either authority is withheld.
3. For publication, select the repository-defined full or light mode and obtain every confirmation its policy requires. Stop on a dirty or ambiguous candidate, divergent release refs, a conflicting target tag or Release, a target version not greater than the latest stable version, a baseline outside the candidate, or an unenrolled or invalid release-notes authority. A matching partial publication follows the recovery reference instead of restarting QA or recreating an existing object.
4. Resolve this skill's directory and run the release-notes inspector with `--expected-version <version>` plus exactly one established baseline: `--previous-release <latest-stable-tag>`, or `--first-release` after the user confirms that no stable tag or completed release exists. Treat its JSON as structural evidence only; independently inspect semantic coverage.

## Settle the Candidate Before QA

Compare every commit and material changed surface after the previous stable release with the open changelog section. For a confirmed first release, use the complete reachable history and current public surface with no regression baseline. Present one exact diff that merges duplicates and adds, edits, or removes only entries needed to describe shipped outcomes.

Obtain approval before applying it. When this creates a change, validate it and commit the exact approved preparation through `/skill:task-commit` with `intentional no-note`; the settlement commit must not add an entry about itself.

Do not push a candidate before release QA. Query live remote `main` and proceed only when it equals the clean committed local `main` candidate or is a verified ancestor of it. Require the configured upstream to identify the publication remote's `main` branch, but do not require its cached tracking SHA to equal the candidate.

Record the candidate SHA, live remote SHA, and `equal` or `ancestor` relationship. Stop as `INCOMPLETE` when remote access, the remote object, or ancestry cannot be established without fetching, or when the candidate is behind or diverged. Every remediation candidate must satisfy the same relationship before confirmation QA.

The handler's explicit release request is an authorized handoff for exactly one release-qa pass against the disclosed version and candidate. Preserve every release-qa convergence and confirmation boundary; never reinterpret a finding fix or focused check as a passing candidate.

When remediation changes a shipped outcome, update the open changelog entry in the same reviewed remediation commit. A new candidate follows the release-qa confirmation contract. Preserve the full pass's authoritative frozen confirmation record and retained evidence root.

Build the confirmation manifest only through the release-QA skill's deterministic helper: `scripts/manage_release_qa.py prepare-confirmation --input <prepare.json> --output <full-evidence-root>/confirmation-manifest.json`. The input names the canonical frozen record, current exact candidate, changed-surface mappings, and finding reproductions.

The helper copies its complete cluster and scenario inventory and entry facts without re-deriving, regrouping, or sampling them, then appends only the current candidate, exact non-empty remediation range, those mappings and reproductions, and the one-attempt fact.

If the helper rejects the retained record, evidence, ancestry, changed-surface coverage, finding reproduction coverage, or output boundary, stop as `INCOMPLETE` before invoking confirmation. Never manually repair or bypass its manifest. Stop when QA is incomplete, findings remain, or the permitted confirmation does not pass.

## Create and Publish the Release

After QA passes, re-inspect the exact candidate and confirm that changelog entries are byte-identical to the passing candidate. The sole later candidate exception is one approved QA-neutral direct child established under the gate-convergence reference; keep its direct-QA SHA and release-basis SHA distinct.

Apply only repository-authorized release metadata: the published version, pinned validation expectation, the changelog heading's `Unreleased` to publication-date transition, and deterministic release links when the repository uses them. Any entry-text change invalidates QA and returns to candidate settlement.

Before running the selected repository release gate, show its exact commands and obtain separate explicit authority; selecting `full` or `light` does not itself authorize tests or other gate commands. If authority is withheld, leave the gate unrun and stop as incomplete.

In full mode, freeze its authoritative public checkpoints and include the aggregate and every possible suffix command in the requested convergence authority. In light mode, preserve the repository's fixed reduced gate and stop when policy requires full verification. Never split recipe lines or infer resumable stages from command output.

Run only the approved gate commands and all required mismatch checks. On a full-gate failure, use the gate-convergence reference: rerun only the failing public checkpoint through the frozen suffix while diagnosing, settle at most one correction commit for that cycle, and require the complete authoritative gate to pass once from the beginning without candidate mutation before release. Suffix completion is never release-gate `PASS`.

A QA-affecting correction requires new full release QA with explicit authority; the current invocation stops before that pass. The handler may instead restart once from a proven, explicitly approved QA-neutral direct child without rerunning release QA; never classify a small diff by size, accept a second reuse, or report the direct child as directly QA-passed. A new invocation re-establishes all facts and authority.

Do not commit or publish when a required check fails or is missing. After explicit commit approval, create exactly one repository-conforming release commit through `/skill:task-commit` with `intentional no-note`. Preserve the direct-QA candidate SHA, release-basis candidate SHA, QA binding, release commit and parent, QA result, and release-gate result in the active handler report, then obtain separate push and publication authority.

Publish in this order unless stricter repository policy overrides it:

1. push `main` and verify the exact remote release commit;
2. create an annotated target-version tag on that commit and push it;
3. create the hosted Release using the settled changelog entries as highlights and current gate evidence as a separate validation section;
4. verify remote `main`, the peeled tag, and hosted Release target the intended release commit.

Before every publication mutation and after every successful step, re-query live remote `main`, recompute its ancestry relationship to the release-basis candidate without fetching, and run `scripts/inspect_publication_state.py` with a fresh non-expanding `aquarium-release-publication-observation/v4` JSON observation. Bind exact QA directly, or bind one approved QA-neutral direct child while retaining the distinct direct-QA evidence SHA.

Perform only its one returned next action after obtaining that action's authority. A remote `main` that still equals or is an ancestor of the release-basis candidate permits the single fast-forward `push_main`; a different descendant, divergence, unavailable relationship, `conflict`, or `unproven` state stops as `INCOMPLETE`. A `matching` step is skipped. Never rewrite or delete a published tag or Release without explicit destructive-action authorization naming the exact objects.

## Open the Next Cycle

Only after publication verification, ask the user for the next planned stable version. Verify that it is greater than the published version and has no tag, hosted Release, or completed changelog section. The target is provisional and may later be retargeted through this skill with explicit approval.

Show the exact new empty `Unreleased` section and request separate commit authority. If approved, apply and validate it, create one non-release commit through `/skill:task-commit` with `intentional no-note`, then request separate push authority. If any authority is withheld, leave the published release complete, make no implied mutation, and report that enrolled commits must wait for an open target.

## Report

Return the intended version, mode, previous release or confirmed first-release baseline, every candidate and release commit SHA including the distinct direct-QA, release-basis, and correction commit identities, QA binding, exact reuse-attempt fact and approval, changelog path and decision, release-qa result and evidence root, frozen gate checkpoints, and suffix and final aggregate commands and exit codes.

Also return publication-state classification and per-object status, push, tag, hosted Release and peeled-target verification, next planned version and its separate commit or gap, current Git state, and any remaining uncertainty.
