# Refactor

Create or revise exactly one refactor epic in the canonical roadmap. Do not implement, stage, commit, publish, or edit the Design Gate registry.

Always read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md), then read [ouroboros-integration.md](../../references/ouroboros-integration.md), [design-gates.md](../../references/design-gates.md), and [documentation-governance.md](../../references/documentation-governance.md), and use the default `aquarium-design-v2` Podway path.

Resolve the target roadmap's recorded identity contract before allocating an epic or task ID. Trace current contracts, consumers, data and runtime seams, compatibility guarantees, migration ordering, rollback, observability, failure containment, and proof of behavior preservation or intentional change.

After the approved envelope, use installed upstream `/skill:interview` and `/skill:seed` as needed. Produce one ordered epic whose work units keep compatibility, migration, rollback, and verification ownership explicit. Put an explicit `Design Gate impact` of `Not required`, `Pending`, or resolved `GATE-*` IDs on the epic and every implementation task, propagating the epic decision unless a task has a narrower resolved impact; new invariants remain pending for `/skill:design-qa`.

Run upstream `/skill:qa`, adjudicate the draft, show the exact diff, and apply only after explicit approval and snapshot recheck. End with the epic identity, affected contracts, validation, gate status, and unresolved migration risks.
